# ALU Design for High-Performance SoC

## 1. Motivation for Assignment Selection

The selection of this digital circuit design assignment is not just about implementing a simple circuit but is directly linked to real industry demands. The rationale behind choosing this assignment is as follows:

### User Requirements
- Users demand fast, power-efficient, and low-heat smartphones for seamless mobile gaming.
- To meet these requirements, a high-performance and low-power **SoC (System on Chip)** is essential.

### SoC Planning Phase
- Modern SoCs, such as **Samsung Exynos** and **Qualcomm Snapdragon**, integrate multiple functionalities.
- Optimized SoCs for mobile gaming include key components like **CPU, GPU, NPU, and Modem**.
- Performance optimization is crucial, as seen in past **GOS (Game Optimization Service) controversies**.

### The Core Component of SoC ‚Äì CPU
- The **CPU** plays a crucial role in executing computations within the SoC.
- Based on the **ARM Cortex series**, the CPU processes instructions to perform calculations.
- CPU performance heavily depends on the design and optimization of the **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**.

## 2. Assignment Goal ‚Äì ALU Design

This project focuses on designing an **ALU**, the core computational unit within the CPU.

### Role of ALU
- Performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logical operations**.
- Serves as the primary computational unit within the CPU.
- Includes fundamental components such as an **Adder circuit**.

### ALU Structure
- Typically utilizes architectures like **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** or **Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)**.
- Various optimization techniques are applied to improve computational speed.
